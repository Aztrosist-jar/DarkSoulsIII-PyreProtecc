# DarkSoulsIII-PyreProtecc
Pyre-Protecc :

How to use? ;

Once you start DarkSoulsIII you can then launch the application `PyresDLLInjector` up, You will be prompted with a message to allow it to run. Just select "YES" and everything will be done.

Why should I run this? ;
I simply wanted to give people back the safety of trying to invade and PVP/PVE. Being able to play online is a crucial part of this game and since late 2017 the games state has been slowly dropping and getting unplayable due to various people giving out exploits. I have simply tried to patch every exploit that I know of the best way I could without affecting gameplay too much. I am still updating and fixing the patches I have included in my injector/dll. I'm not perfect or the best programmer out there but from testing this out you have a way better chance at surviving the cheater pool then to run without protections. If you want a better patch then please use PVP watchdogs , Its a great program written by very talented people. My DLL allows the use of cheat engine so you may use whatever scripts you liked to use for setting up survival / PVP experiences but this will not allow you to reverse out my DLL via the memory view / debugging methods.

You must have Ainsleys anticheat bypass to use this DLL. I hate to lay the foundations of my DLL upon his bypass but I am not good/ experienced enough to write my own bypass as of now. But I figured allowing people to play online again was worth the issue.

This DLL patches out;
 * Invalid animation crash
 * Invalid coordinate crash
 * Invalid ItemDrop
 * Drops various exploits including the "Ban packet". 
 * ForcedIdles
 * Invalid PlayerStructure
 * Slayers ( Just disables the param nothing fancy ) 
 * ItemCrashs
 * Invalid NPC Summon
 * Invalid NPC action
 * Various invalid packets

What this DLL does;
This DLL will also reshade your game, It was my personal VFX settings I liked. Made dark souls III less washed out and makes the atmosphere more gloomy. You will be prompted with a message if you would like to reshade it or not. 

If you have any issues at all using this or run into any compatibility flaws please join my server and explain what it does at *https://discord.gg/ZWA36YT*. Thanks !
